# Gesture-Controlled Drone System *(Work in Progress)*  

This project is a **gesture-controlled drone system** designed to recognize **hand signals** such as **left, right, up, down, and stop** to control the drone's movement. The system integrates **object detection** and **hand signal recognition** using **YOLOv5** and **OpenCV** and aims to support **dual modes**â€”**reconnaissance** and **search-and-rescue**.  

## Project Goals  
- **Gesture-Based Control:** Enable drone navigation and actions based on predefined hand signals.  
- **Dual Operation Modes:**  
  - **Reconnaissance Mode:** Focuses on stealth and data collection.  
  - **Search-and-Rescue Mode:** Prioritizes visibility and signaling to aid in rescue operations.  
- **Area Sweep Functionality:** Two drones coordinate to divide and search areas effectively.  
- **Hardware Integration:** Incorporates sensors, cameras, and IMUs for precise movement and targeting.  
- **Compact Design:** Optimized for portability and ease of deployment.  

## Features *(Planned)*  
- **Hand Signal Recognition:** Detects gestures like left, right, up, down, and stop.  
- **Target Detection and Tracking:** Identifies and follows objects of interest.  
- **Dual-Mode Operations:** Stealth mode for reconnaissance and signaling mode for search-and-rescue.  
- **Remote Control Support:** Integrates with ELRS controllers, such as the Radiomaster Zorro.  
- **Custom Command Execution:** Supports actions triggered by gestures, including firing foam projectiles.  

## Status  
ðŸš§ **Work in Progress** â€“ Currently developing and testing hardware integration, gesture recognition, and movement controls.  

## Dependencies  
- **YOLOv5** â€“ Object detection and classification.  
- **OpenCV** â€“ Image processing and gesture recognition.  
- **Python & C++** â€“ Programming languages for software development.  
- **Betaflight** â€“ Flight controller firmware for drone stability and control.  

## Getting Started *(Pending)*  
A detailed setup guide and installation instructions will be provided once the initial prototype is completed.
